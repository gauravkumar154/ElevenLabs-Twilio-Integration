# ElevenLabs-Twilio-Integration
Build an elevenlabs powered conversational AI agent and deploy that to a real life TWILIO number

Place all your keys and IDs in the env text file, and rename the env file to .env

In order to run deploy the server, please install the dependencies. Will update the readme as soon as possible.
Once running the python server, on  localhost:8080, please connect it to the NGROK.
Then copy the https link to the twilio configuration, in the URL of call.

You can dial in from your phone to the twilio number and talk with the Agent. 

Thanks!!
